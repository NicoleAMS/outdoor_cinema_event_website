# Project Brief

Client:  Watch it Outside events Co.
Project:  Boston edition film festival website 
Date:  20.08.2019
Document version:  1.0

## Summary
Watch it Outside events Co. is organising an outdoor summer film festival in Boston Public Garden, Boston, from August 5-8 2020. The  main goal  of the event is to show that films can appeal to audiences of all ages.

In order to promote the festival they need an event website which reflects the event’s main goal. It should also display information about the festival, the films they are showing, and regularly published news or announcements, and include links to Boston’s news and Public Garden websites. The film festival is free, but since space in Boston Public Garden is limited to a maximum of 1500 people at a time, the site needs a registration form where people can register for a free ticket.

## Stakeholders
1. Clara Dunn - founder of Watch it Outside events Co. / event organiser
2. Nicole Sentis - freelance designer / front-end developer
3. Jane Doe - content writer / photographer

## Goals
The overall goal is to design and develop a website that reflects the event’s main goal and layout requirements and have it up and running by January 2020.

The design should reflect that films can appeal to audiences of all ages.

The design should make it easy for people to find the information they are looking for (e.g. what films are showing and when) and to register for the event.

The site should display
* Information about the festival
* The films they are showing
* News and announcements about the festival
* Links to Boston’s news website(s)
* Link to the Boston Public Garden website
* Links to event’s social media (e.g. Twitter, Instagram, Facebook)
* A registration form for free tickets that keeps track of how many people have tickets per day, so not more than 1500 tickets per day

## Budget
The budget to get the website up and running is  $3,500 .

## Timeline
It should take about  4-4,5 months  to get the site up and running, which means with a start in early September 2019, the site could be launched by the end of December 2019/early January 2020.
