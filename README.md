OpenClassrooms Front-End Developer path project: 'Analyze a client's needs for their film festival'

## Introduction
This webpage is a mockup for an imaginary outdoor film festival, which I designed and developed based on a brief with specific requirements. I also wrote a project outline brief for the imaginary client with sections that describe the stakeholders, goals, budget, timeline and technical specifications.

Both brief with requirments and the project brief can be found in the documents folder above.

## Technologies
The technologies I used were:
* HTML 5 / CSS 3
* SCSS ( gulp-sass 4)
* Bootstrap 4
* Gulp 4
* Font Awesome 4
* Google Fonts 

The use of Bootstrap 4 was one of the project's requirements. I also wanted to use SCSS and learn how to use and set up Gulp with SCSS and browserSync.
